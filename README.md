# My Animal Repository

## Project Overview

This project is a Python application designed to process structured animal data from a JSON file and generate a static HTML web page (`web/animals.html`) to display the information. The application allows the user to filter the displayed animals based on their skin type (e.g., Fur, Hair, Scales).

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into modules responsible for data management, HTML generation, and the main application logic:

* **`animals_web_generator.py`**:
    * The main entry point of the application.
    * It displays the filter menu, handles user input for the skin type, and orchestrates the web page generation.

* **`data/`**:
    * **`animals_data.json`**: The core data source containing the taxonomy and characteristics of the animals.
    * **`json_manager.py`**: Handles loading the raw JSON data. It provides properties to retrieve individual animal details and generate the unique list of skin types for the filter menu.

* **`web/`**:
    * **`animals_template.html`**: The base HTML file containing the document structure, CSS styling, and a placeholder (`__REPLACE_ANIMALS_INFO__`) for the animal cards.
    * **`animals.html`**: The final output file generated by the script.
    * **`html_manager.py`**: Manages HTML-specific tasks, including:
        * Loading the template content.
        * Formatting individual animal records into styled HTML card snippets.
        * Injecting necessary meta tags and custom CSS.
        * Saving and verifying the final HTML file.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3.  Execute the main application file:

    ```bash
    python animals_web_generator.py
    ```

4.  The program will greet you and present a menu of available skin type filters (e.g., `1. Fur`, `2. Hair`).
5.  **Input:**
    * Enter the number corresponding to a filter (e.g., `1` for Fur) to display only animals matching that skin type.
    * Leave the input empty and press Enter to display **all** animals regardless of skin type.
    * Enter the Exit option (`4. Exit program`) to terminate the application.
6.  Upon successful execution, the resulting animal repository web page will be saved to `web/animals.html`. You can open this file in any web browser to view the output.
